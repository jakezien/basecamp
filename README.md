# Hey Basecamp!

Thanks so much for the opportunity to tackle a design challenge on one of my [favorite things.](https://beta.jakezien.com/favorites)

This week has been a blast, and I've learned a ton. Hope you enjoy reading this code as much as I did writing it â€” I'd never written a line of Ruby before, but Rails and Stimulus made throwing this together no problem. I found them to be as sensible as they are opinionated, a pattern I'm noticing with all things Basecamp.

My writeup is [here](https://beta.jakezien.com/basecamp), and you can play with the app at https://jz-basecamp.herokuapp.com. 

So looking forward to talking through this with you. And whatever happens, thanks for a great mental workout and a truly enjoyable project.

Gratefully,
Jake
