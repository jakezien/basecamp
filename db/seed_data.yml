      body: The seller still hasn't signed his cancellation of contract, so let's be patient a little longer. I'm not sure what his deal is, to be honest with you; this isn't the way things usually go.

        Ravi,

        Thank you so much for all your time, transparency, and enthusiasm as you shepherded me through the Disco interview process. Please extend my gratitude to the team as well; everyone was friendly, welcoming, and generous with their time and candor. 

        I know this outcome isn't what we'd hoped for, but I'm glad that "there are no bridges burned," as you said. I so appreciated learning about this company, meeting an interesting bunch who work on tough problems, receiving the honor of an offer. Thanks for your enthusiasm for my work, and for your effort to create a solution to the weird moment in which I find myself, both at work and outside it.

        My production of Burn This is available today through the 20th. The content and my character are very inflammatory- and can‚Äôt attest to the quality of the recording so I would probably be sparing in sharing it with folks. Enjoy!

        Dear Family,

        As some of you know, Grandma Young (Cathy's Mom and my wonderful mother-in-law) passed away on Monday, June 14, 2021.  She was 87 years old.  Please pray for the repose of her soul and Grandma's entire family, that is two children, two spouses of children, five grandchildren, four spouses of grandchildren, and five great grandchildren.  Please pray for Cathy as she just had surgery this week.

        I have included some of my favorite pictures of Grandma.

        Lots of Love and Blessings to All,
        Bill

        One of the features that make block references so awesome is the "Inline Counter" - the indicator on the right that shows you the number of times a block has been referenced elsewhere. This handy counter was available exclusively from the original block... until now.

        Programming note: Money Stuff will be off tomorrow, back on Monday.

        GameStop
        Here is a Bloomberg article titled ‚ÄúA Longtime Fidelity Manager Sold GameStop, and Has Some Regrets.‚Äù It begins like this:

        Joel Tillinghast has managed the Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund since it was created about 32 years ago, hunting for companies with shares that trade at bargain prices relative to their earnings potential. In 2020, a suffering video-game retailer called GameStop Corp. fit that bill.
